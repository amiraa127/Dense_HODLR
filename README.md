HODLR PACKAGE : Fast dense solver for hierarchically off-diagonal low-rank matrices  
=====================================

This software package is a highly felxible HODLR solver that can be used in a variety of applications. The package can solve matrices that are preallocated in memmory or defined by a kernel function. 

A variety of low-rank approximation methods (SVD, partial pivoting ACA, full pivoting ACA, BDLR, etc.) are available. Furthermore, the package also accepts any custom HODLR partitioning from the user which is very handy in many applications.
