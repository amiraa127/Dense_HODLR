#HODLR PACKAGE : Hierarchically off-diagonal low-rank matrix manipulation package 

This software package is a highly felxible HODLR solver that can be used in a variety of applications. The package can solve matrices that are preallocated in memmory or defined by a kernel function. 

A variety of low-rank approximation methods (SVD, partial pivoting ACA, full pivoting ACA, BDLR, etc.) are available. Furthermore, the package also accepts any custom HODLR partitioning from the user which is very useful in many applications.

####Build
The new version of the HODLR package requires PaStiX and SCOTCH for the sparse embedding functionality. It is important to compile PaStiX with the -DFORCE_NOMPI flag and link PaStiX to SCOTCH not ptSCOTCH. 


The easiest way to build the library is to use [CMake](http://www.cmake.org). Go to the project directory and run:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
```

####Documentation

The documentation for this package is currently located at http://amiraa127.github.io/Dense_HODLR/. It's currently incomplete but I will add material to it gradually.
